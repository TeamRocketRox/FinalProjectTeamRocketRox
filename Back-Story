  In the year 20XX, a new fuel source was found in Uranus.   This fuel was called Topherinium. Topherinium was cleaner and more energy efficient than any type of power source the Earth had ever seen.

	The US government quickly mobilized to gather Topherinium, as did the rest of the world’s major governments.  Naturally, conflicts arose from the race to secure this new fuel source.

	After a series of clashes, the US government reigned as the sole controller of Topherinium.  They capitalized on this opportunity by harvesting massive amounts of the power source to sell to other governments.  This eventually led to America seizing every last trace of Topherinium in Uranus.  

	Unbeknownst to the US government but beknownst to us, humans were not alone in the universe.  

	The natives of Uranus, the Crassamen , were livid at America’s blatant infringement on their territory.  Without Topherinium , their main power source, the Crassamen quickly started to die out.

	The Crassaman king, Jutsin, knew he must go to Earth and demand his power source back. 

	The Americans, however, were not very receptive (picture of Jutsin in jail).

	In a last ditch effort to rescue their revered leader, the Crassamen warriors decided to conduct a siege of Earth.

	Cryx, the US Air Force’s ace space pilot, along with his quirky sidekick, Norson, under orders from their boss, General Tso, agree to take out the incoming Crassamen forces around the world.
