  Team Rocket Rox, which consists of Christopher Brown, Nelson Kelly, Justin Lee, and Allen Zheng, are planning to create a modified version of the classic Space Invaders arcade game. In Space Invaders, the player controls a spaceship that can move horizontally across the bottom portion of the screen. The player shoots at incoming enemy space ships so that they will not attack and destroy the playerâ€™s ship. The player has three barriers that he/she can hide behind and the enemy can fire at these barriers in order to destroy them.
	The group will be modifying this game by changing it to a two-player side-scrolling shooter. The game will include an elaborate, tear-jerking narrative that will be explained through pictures and text.
The objective of this game will remain virtually unchanged from the original arcade game. The player will have to defeat all of the enemy aliens in order to progress through the game. The narrative will give the player additional incentive to complete the game.
  The target audience for this game is anyone who wants to relive the nostalgia of a classic game like Space Invaders with a friend.  It could also be for younger players who have never played the original game and want to play it with a slightly more modern twist.
